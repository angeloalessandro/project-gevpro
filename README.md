<h1>Advanced programming project: Flight passengers satisfaction<h1>
<h2>About the project<h2>
  This is a study on factors that influence the satisfaction of airline passengers. When it comes to satisfaction of airline passengers, a lot of factors can contribute to their experience, this can be before, during or after the flight. The project finds out which factors contribute the most to the satisfaction of these airline passengers. The data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasetscom. The data has been sorted and we decided to analyse only data from passengers who are 18+ years old.
