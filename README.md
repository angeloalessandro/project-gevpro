# Advanced programming project: Flight passenger satisfaction
## About the project
  This is a study on factors that influence the satisfaction of airline passengers. When it comes to satisfaction of airline passengers, a lot of factors can contribute to their experience, this can be before, during or after the flight. The project finds out which factors contribute the most to the satisfaction of these airline passengers. The dataset used is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasetscom). The data has been sorted and we decided to analyse only data from passengers who were at least 18 years old. We have used a jupyter notebook along with the [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn) Python libraries.
## Division of labour
  There are 12 factors that we paid attention to. Each group member worked on 4 elements:
  
  1. **Angelo**
  - Food and drinks
  - In-flight service
  - In-flight entertaintment
  - Baggage handling
  2. **Elena**
  - Departure delay
  - Arrival delay
  - Departure and Arrival time convenience
  - Ease of online booking
  3. **Shaya**
  - Check-in service
  - On-board services
  - Seat comfort
  - Cleanliness
  ## How to use
  The notebook can be run by running all cells in the jupyter notebook sequentially. All of the results will be visible in the output. In the markdown among the code, the results are discussed.
